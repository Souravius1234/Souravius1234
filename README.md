Hello there!

I am Sourav Ghosh, currently a Senior (fourth-year) in College, majoring in Aerospace Engineering.

I work on projects all the time, mostly related to embedded systems, electronics, aerospace simulations and autonomous systems. I am also working on Bachelor's thesis, which is related to Guidance and Control of Space vehicles in interstellar space.

I dream of working on interplanetary space missions some day, taking mankind to new distances in the universe. 
Contact me if you wish to know more! Details available on my website!
