Hello there!

I am Sourav Ghosh, an Aerospace Engineer from Indiaã€€and a graduate student at Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, The University of Tokyo. 
My focus study areas include Astrodynamics, Aerodynamics, Plasma Flow Simulations, Embedded Systems and Robotics. 

I don't know what else to write here lol, so I'm gonna leave it like this for now. I'll be adding more codes here, and hopefully make them open-source at some point.
Have a great day/night ahead. Thanks for dropping by my profile.
